# Chapter 13: Capstone Project Part 2: Implementation and Evaluation

In this final week, you will complete your implementation, debug your system, and evaluate its performance.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Implement complex robotic behaviors.
- Debug distributed ROS 2 systems.
- Collect and analyze performance data.
- Present your work in a professional demo.

## 13.1 Iterative Development

Robotics development is highly iterative. You will likely spend 80% of your time debugging:
- **Physics Glitches**: Why did the robot suddenly fly into space? (Usually inertia or collision issues).
- **Communication Latency**: Why is the camera data lagging? (Usually network or QoS issues).
- **AI Failures**: Why did the robot ignore the red cup? (Usually training data or lighting issues).

## 13.2 Evaluation and Benchmarking

A good engineer doesn't just say "it works." They provide data.
- **Success Rate**: Out of 10 attempts, how many were successful?
- **Computation Time**: How long does the AI inference take?
- **Path Efficiency**: How far did the robot walk compared to the ideal path?

## 13.3 Creating a Demo Video

Your demo video is your "resume" for this project.
- **Show the Failure**: It's okay to show the robot failing and then explaining how you fixed it.
- **Visual Clarity**: Use RViz or Isaac Sim's built-in cameras to show different perspectives.
- **Narrative**: Explain *what* the robot is doing and *why* it's difficult.

## 13.4 Final Submission Requirements

1. **GitHub Link**: Containing all code, URDFs, and launch files.
2. **Technical Report**: A 3-5 page document explaining your approach, challenges, and results.
3. **Demo Video**: A 90-second recording of your robot in action.
